\section{boundaries}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What messages did I recieve about boundaries in my childhood? Were they encouraged, dismissed or punished?
    \textcolor{red}{I was not allowed to have any sort of boundaries in any sense of the matter/ My doors were removed as a child; I was watched and monitored every night. I was never left along and my grivences were trivialized and mocked.}
  \item Are there specific experiences in my past where boundaries were ignored or violated? How did that shape my current beliefs about bounfaries?
    \textcolor{red}{The example I frequently mention is the one of the door but there exist a multitude of examples below the surface of my memory.}
  \item How did the adults in my life model boundary-setting (or lack of it)?
    \textcolor{red}{In all honesty, they modeled that those in positions of authority should give no leeway to those below them: the boundaries are set by those with power and those left to suffer are those without.}
