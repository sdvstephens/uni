% Your notes here...

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Death. The waves/ water. 
  \item Hunger. Example of resistance and adjustement
  \item She is profitable
  \item We all, to some extent, fear death; we may, however, use a conduit to face that fear: Piper uses their conquering of the ocean waves to distract them from their fear of death until it rears its head in another circumstance. 
  \item Fear of being forgotten; fear of being alone; fear of permanent failure; intellectual decline. 
  \item \textbf{Greatest:} fear of missing my future. One hundred seventeen-thousand, six hundred and fourty nine. 
\end{enumerate}

I have lived in my head for so long that I have forgotten what the flowers smell like; what the grass feels like; the crepuscular dawning from the drops of dew in the grass, radiating their brilliance to the many exoskelutar citizens below. I watch; I observe; I wait. But none of it is real. Not that that mattered to begin with, but you know, angsty philosophy only takes you so far.
