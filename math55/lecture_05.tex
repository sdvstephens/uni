\subsection{Symmetry Groups}

An alternative to number systems as the basis of groups is symmetries of systems/ objects. To construct these consider the set \( S \) and a group acting on the set \( S \) called the permutation group \( Perm(S) \) which is the set of bijective maps \( f: S \leftrightarrow S \) has a law of composition defined as function composition. The order of the group \( Perm(S) \) is \( |Perm(S)| =n! \) when \( S \) is finite (usually this is the case with a permutation group). If \( S = \{ 1,2,\ldots ,n \} \) then \( Perm(S) \) is denoted \( S_n \) is is known as the symmetry group.

\begin{definition}[Symmetric Groups]
  The symmetric group is a set \( Perm(S) \) acting on a set \( S \) of order \( n \), denoted \( S_n \) such that \( Perm(S) \) is the set of bijective maps \( f: S \leftrightarrow S \) with the law of composition of \( Perm(S) \) being function composition. We denote the permutations via \( \sigma^n  \) and \( \tau ^n \), where \( \sigma  \) is a permutation via shifts and \( \tau  \) is a permutation via swaping two given elements. 
\end{definition}


\begin{problem}[1.1.1]
  We know that the group \( S_n \) is non-abelian \( \forall n\ge 3 \). Why is this? First we demonstrate by example. Consider the group with the set \( S =\{1,2,3,4\}\), notice that \( |S_4| =4! =24 \). The group is made of up a sequence of perumtations \( e,\sigma ,\sigma^2,\sigma^3,\tau ,\tau \sigma ,\tau \sigma^2,\tau \sigma^3 \), where \( \sigma ^n \) is a shift of order \( n \) such that \( (1,2,\ldots,m )\mapsto (\ldots ,m,1,2,\ldots ) \), so, for example, \( (1,2,3)\) under \( \sigma^2 \) results in \(\sigma^2(1,2,3)=(2,3,1)\) since \( (1,2,3)\overset{\sigma}{\mapsto} (3,1,2) \overset{\sigma}{\mapsto} (2,3,1) \). The \( \tau  \) is a switch between any two elements: \( (1,2,3)\overset{\tau}{\mapsto}(1,3,2) \), but \( \tau ^2 \) simply reverses whatever mapping we made by acting on the same elements we applied \( \tau  \) to, i.e., \( (1,2,3)\overset{\tau}{\mapsto}(1,3,2)\overset{\tau }{\mapsto}(1,2,3) \). Given these facts, (note that we are going to drop the commas for the sequence of numbers) notice that \( \tau \sigma (1234) \implies (1234)\overset{\sigma}{\mapsto} (4123) \overset{\tau }{\mapsto} (1423)\), but \( \sigma \tau (1234)\implies (1234)\overset{\tau }{\mapsto} (2134) \overset{\sigma  }{\mapsto} (4213) \). Notice, then, that \( (1423)\neq (4213) \), thus it mustn't be the case that \( S_4 \) is abelian. This, in general, is true for all \( S_n \mid n\ge 3 \). 
\end{problem}

A similar notion that arises from symmetric groups is the dihedral group: the set of symmetries of \( S \) under rotation and reflection where \( S \) is the set of verticies of a regular \( n \)-gon in the plane (a plane). We call this \( D_n \). 


\begin{definition}[Dihedral Groups]
  A dihedral group, denoted \( D_n \) is the set of symmetries of \( S \) under rotation and reflection (function composition) as the law of composition, where \( S \) is the set of all verticies of a regular \( n \)-gon. This is a special type of symmetric group. 
\end{definition}

As a quick side-note we use \( \mu  \) and \( \rho  \) is function notation for our relfections and rotations, respectively, in relation to dihedral groups. There is a good amount of similarity with \( \tau  \) and \( \sigma  \) from symmetric groups.

\pagebreak

\begin{problem}[1.1.2]
  Consider the dihedral group \( D_{3} \), notice that it is isomorphic to \( S_{3} \). Notice, however, that this is not the case for \( D_{4} \) and \( S_{4} \). We use \( \rho  \) and \( \mu  \) for rotations and reflections (LoC) under \( D_{n} \) (similar to \( \sigma  \) and \( \tau  \)). For \( D_{3} \) we have a \( 3 \)-gon, which is simply a triangle. We may assign to each of its three verticies a number such that under the transformations of \( \rho  \) and \( \mu  \) we achieve rotations and reflections. Below is an example of this:


  \begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./figures/d3.pdf}
    \caption{}
    \label{}
\end{figure}

The observed triangle is a geometric representation of \( D_{3} \). We can see that the order is given by \( |D_{3}|=|\{ e,\rho ,\rho ^2,\mu ,\mu \rho ,\mu \rho ^2 \}|=6 \), the same as \( S_3 \); however when observing \( D_{4} \) and \( S_{4} \), we notice that these are incapible of being isomorphic since they have different orders: \(|D_4|=|\{ e, \rho ,\rho ^2,\rho ^3,\mu ,\mu \rho ,\mu \rho ^2,\mu \rho ^3\} | =8 \) and \( |S_{4}|=|\{ e,\sigma ,\sigma ^2,\sigma ^3,\tau \sigma ,\tau \sigma ^2,\tau \sigma ^3,\tau ^2 \sigma , \ldots  \}| = 24 \). Interesting! It seems, from observation that while \( S_n \) follows the rule of order \( n! \), \( D_n \) follows the rule of order \( 2n \). Notice that the mappings that involve \( \mu  \) in \( D_{3} \) are all reflections on a different axis of symmetry, the axis of symmetry under \( e, \rho  \) and \( \rho ^2 \). We can thus imagine \( D_{3} \) as \( 2n \) due to the fact that it has \( n \) rotations, and therefore \( n \) axies of symmetry \( \implies n+n=2n \).\qed



\end{problem}

Something to note is that, as we increase in dimensionality (recall that \( D_n \) is restricted to \( n \)-gons in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \)), i.e., as \( n \) increases for \( \mathbb{R}^n \), then the order of the group has more and more complex reflections (\( \mu  \)s), which meet \( S_{n} \)'s order and even exceeds it. A general rule is: for \( \mathbb{R}^n \), \( |G|=2^n(n!) \). The number of rotations and reflections, however, can be infinite (for example consider the set of all symmetries of a circle). 

\begin{definition}[Linearity]
  Linearity of a bijective function is determined by the rule that \( \phi (v+w)=\phi (v)+\phi (w), \forall  v,w \in  \mathbb{R}^n \) and \( \phi (\lambda v) , \forall v \in \mathbb{R}^n, \lambda \in  \mathbb{R}\). Notice our \( v,w \) quantities are vectors and our \( \lambda  \) quantity is a scalar. 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[General and Special Linear Groups]

  Consider the symmetries of \( S=\mathbb{R}^n \) but restrict the set of bijections to be only those which are linear (as defined in the previous definition). This forms the group \( GL_n(\mathbb{R}) \), i.e., the group of \( n \times n \) matrices with nonzero determinant. Similarly, a special case is \( SL_n(\mathbb{R}) \), which is the special linear group which is the same as the general linear group except the determinant is specified to be \( 1 \). 
  
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Orthogonal Groups]
  An orthogonal group is a type of symmetric group that is the linear maps \( \Gamma : \mathbb{R}^n \to  \mathbb{R}^n \) that respect (preserve) distance.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Group Relations}

\begin{definition}[Subgroups]
  A subgroup of \( G \) is a subset \( H \subset G \) such that \( H \) is closed under the law of composition of \( G \) (i.e., \( \forall a,b \in  H ab \in  H \)) and \( \forall a \in  H \exists a^{-1} \in  H \) s.t. \( aa^{-1}=e \). 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Generators and Generation]
  Group generation happens as a concequence of our definition of subgroups. Notice, that given \( H \le G \) (we use \( \le\) and \(\ge \) notation to indicate subgroup-ness) we can construct the smallest subgrop of \( G \) by taking the intersection of all subgroups of \( G \); notice that this intersection is indeed a subgroup as well. For generation of a group we want to take the samllest subset denoted \( S \subset G\) such that there exist a samllest subgroup that contains \( S \):
  \begin{displaymath}
    G_{smallest}=\bigcap_{H\le G; H\ge S} H
  \end{displaymath}
  we use the terminology that \( S= \langle S \rangle  \) is the generator of \( G \) if \( \langle S \rangle = G \).
\end{definition}

We can now use this bit of information to come up with a more formal definition of cyclic groups:

\begin{definition}[Cyclic Groups]
  A group is a cyclic group \( \iff \) all elements in the group are generated by a single element.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Homomorphisms}
\begin{definition}[Homomorphisms]
  If \( H \) and \( G \) are two groups, a homomorphism is given by \( \varphi : H \to  G \) as a map that respects the laws of composition in \( G \) and \( H \), i.e., \( \forall a,b\in H \),
  \begin{displaymath}
    \varphi (ab)=\varphi (a)\varphi (b).
  \end{displaymath}
  We can denote this using a commutative diagram,

  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
G \times  G\arrow{r}{\varphi \times  \varphi } \arrow[swap]{d}{m_G} & H \times  H \arrow{d}{m_H} \\%
G \arrow{r}{\varphi}& H,
\end{tikzcd}
\] 
where \( m_G, m_H \) are the laws of compsoition for \( G,H \), respectively. What makes this diagram a homomorphism is thereby the very fact that it commutes. 
\end{definition}

Let's take two interesting cases: the inverse and the identity of a group under homomorphism: consider \( e_H \) and \( e_G \). By homomorphism, it must be the case that \( \varphi (e_He_G)=\varphi (e_H) \varphi (e_G) \), however, notice that since this is the identity, in order to preserve group structure, we result in the identity (\( e_H \) or simply \( e \)). if this is the case we can say \( \varphi (e_G)=e \) and \( \varphi (e_H)=e \), thus, \( \varphi (e_H)=e=\varphi (e_G) \). Similarly, take the inverse of some given \( a \in  G \), \( a^{-1} \in  G \), notice that \( \varphi (a^{-1})=\varphi (a)^{-1} \).
