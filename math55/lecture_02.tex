\section{quicknotesbcipaddied}

\( (3) \implies (1) \). Assume \( G / K \) coset mult is a grp.  s.t. G to G/K 



Remark:

given a group homomorphism \( \phi  : G\to  H \), then \( K=\text{ker}(\phi ) \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \), and \(  \phi  \) factors as \( G \to  G / K \to  \Im(\phi ) \hookrightarrow H \)  a maps to aK maps to phi (a). This is the same grp. isomorphism from earlier. 


Ex: \( S_{3} \) are perm. of 1,2,3. iso. to \( D_{3} \). Three transportations of swapping elements these correspond to reflections of a triangle and have order 2; we have two 3-cycles (correspond to rotations and have order 3).
